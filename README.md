# terraform-validate-explorer

![](./img/icon_64x64.png)

`terraform-validate-explorer` is a tool that helps you search and filter resource instances from the output file
generated by `terraform validate -json`. Those files can easily be longer than 50000 lines so filtering their contents
can be of help while upgrading Terraform provider versions and dealing with deprecated resources.

## Get it

### Prebuilt binaries

Look for a release binary for your operating system on the [Releases page](https://github.com/ivica-k/terraform-validate-explorer/releases).

### From source

No binary available? Clone this repository and:

```text
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## Features

### "contains" filter

Search for all resources that have `tables_future_read` in the name (Snowflake ["future" grants](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/grant-privilege#future-grants-on-database-or-schema-objects)
are amazing btw!)

### "does not contain" filter

To verify that only `snowflake_` resources are deprecated, I filtered all the warnings that do not contain the word
`snowflake`:

### "regex" filter

If the other two filters are not cutting it for you, you can always do it with
[one of the worlds's write-only languages](https://blog.codinghorror.com/regular-expressions-now-you-have-two-problems/).

Suppose you want to look for a resource instance that has `future_` in the name, followed by a four-letter word that is
at the end of the resource name:
